POSSIBLE GAME MECHANICS
==================================================================================


LIMITED COMMUNICATION possibilities
==================================================================================
Restricted Communication:
Players could have limited verbal communication during the heist phase. For instance, they might be allowed to communicate using only specific keywords or gestures, simulating the restricted communication between heist members to avoid detection.

Player Communication Tokens:
Each player might have a limited number of communication tokens to spend during the heist. These tokens could represent their ability to convey specific messages or instructions. Once used, they might not be replenished until a specific game event or turn.

Team Coordination Challenges:
This limitation on communication can make strategic planning more challenging. Players would need to make crucial decisions on their turns or actions with minimal discussion, enhancing the game's tension and decision-making process.

Risk-Reward Communication Mechanics:
There could be a risk-reward element associated with using communication tokens. Players might have to weigh the importance of each message or instruction against the limited tokens they possess.

Role-Specific Communication:
Some team members might have slightly more leeway in communication due to their role's nature or special ability. For example, a hacker might have a skill allowing them to "hack" more communication tokens, enabling enhanced interaction among players for a brief period.


STEALTH/SNEAK possibilities
==================================================================================
Dice or Card-Based Stealth Checks:
Each player's actions could involve dice or card-based checks to determine the success of their stealthy maneuvers. For example, a player attempting to bypass security could roll dice or draw cards, with certain symbols denoting success or failure in remaining undetected.

Hidden Movement:
Use a hidden movement system where players secretly plan their movements on a separate sheet or with hidden cards, only revealing their path or location when required by the game's mechanics. This could represent the unpredictability of their movements and the challenge of keeping a low profile.

Risk vs. Reward:
Actions involving stealth could have escalating risks, with more valuable rewards for successful but riskier maneuvers. Players would need to balance the temptation of greater rewards with the potential for exposure and failure.

PERSUASION and IMPERSONATION possibilities
==================================================================================
Role-Playing Cards or Abilities:
Certain team members might possess special cards or abilities related to persuasion or impersonation. These could be used during specific phases to influence guards or other NPCs encountered during the heist.

Impersonation Challenges:
Players could have the option to attempt impersonation or persuasion by drawing challenge cards or rolling dice that represent the difficulty of successfully fooling or convincing a target. Success could yield advantages such as easier access to certain areas or information.

Consequences of Failure:
If a persuasion or impersonation attempt fails, it could lead to heightened security or alter the game state in a way that makes the heist more challenging, thereby incorporating consequences for unsuccessful attempts.


ALARMS and DISCOVERY possibilities
==================================================================================

NPC Patrol Routes:
Designate specific paths or areas for NPCs to patrol. When an NPC is incapacitated, the player responsible should note or indicate the location of the fallen NPC.

Discovery Timer:
Introduce a discovery timer or tracker that simulates the time it takes for another NPC to come across the incapacitated NPC. This could be determined by dice rolls, card draws, or a designated number of turns.

Alarm Level Escalation:
When an NPC discovers the fallen comrade, an alarm level could increase. For instance, if one NPC finds another incapacitated, the alarm level might escalate by one notch on a tracker. This escalation could trigger more stringent security measures or limitations on players' actions.

Player Responses:
Players may have limited options once an alarm is triggered, such as having to deal with heightened security or additional challenges. This could lead to increased difficulty in completing certain objectives or prompt a change in the heist's plan.

Strategic Decision-Making:
This mechanic introduces a risk-reward element, where players need to strategize not only in taking down NPCs but also in managing the risk of discovery and subsequent alarm escalation.
